# Tic-Tac-Toe Board Lesson

## Background

### What is Our Goal?

We have just learned what a class is in object-oriented programming and how it might theoretically help us write better code. Now it is time to put it into practice with an example!

We are going to write some C++ code that will implement a tic-tac-toe board. We will start with some unorganized code written directly in `main`, and then slowly evolve it to use classes. Be on the lookout for where we use the four principles of object-oriented programming:

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance (Not Used in This Lesson)
4. Polymorphism (Not Used in This Lesson)

### Why Tic-Tac-Toe?

I like to use tic-tac-toe as an example app because:

1. Most people know how to play the game, so there is shared knowledge on how it should work.
2. The game is surprisingly rich in teaching value. You can talk about a huge variety of topics including code design, testing strategies, client/server architectures, and much more!

## Compiling and Running the App

You can compile this code using a C++ compiler of your choice and then execute the compiled app. On a Mac, this looks like:

```bash
g++ boardExample.cpp -o boardExample
./boardExample
```

## Checkpoints

1. Checkpoint 1 - No code structure
